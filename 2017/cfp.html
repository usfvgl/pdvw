<h2>Pedagogy of Data Visualization Workshop<br/>
  <small><a href="http://vgl.cs.usfca.edu/pdvw/2016/">http://vgl.cs.usfca.edu/pdvw/2016/</a></small></h2>

In this workshop, we will continue to sustain a community of practice that provides a structured medium to learn data visualization teaching strategies from each other. The focus is on sharing innovations in the classroom when teaching data visualization.  The half-day interactive workshop that will include lightning talks/demonstrations followed by breakout sessions focused on topics related to teaching large classes, teaching at a liberal arts college, teaching a professional masters' course, and so on.
