<p class="">Welcome to the inaugural <strong>Pedagogy of Data Visualization Workshop (PDVW 2016)</strong>, which will be held at IEEE VIS 2016 in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

<p>The pedagogy of data visualization is becoming increasingly important as data visualization techniques and tools proliferate. In this half-day interactive workshop, we propose to create a community of practice that supports each other as they learn to be better teachers in their respective classrooms.</p>
